# Sorting-Algorithms-Comparison

In this project I have implemented 5 random sorting algorithms then compared their efficiency (CPU time x array size x quantity of instructions).

Algorithms I've found interesting to compare so far:
* Bubblesort;
* Mergesort;
* Insertionsort;
* Combsort;
* Cocktailsort;

*PS: All arrays are being randomly generated, so I'm not comparing their worst-case.
